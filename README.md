# Pose Detection Web Application

## Overview

This project is a **pose detection web application** that uses **ml5.js** and **p5.js** libraries to detect human poses from a video feed captured via the user's webcam. The application visualizes key points on the user's body and draws the skeleton in real-time. It also attempts to classify common poses such as the T-pose, Hands Up pose, and Squat pose.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pose Detection:** Detects human body poses and displays the keypoints (e.g., wrists, elbows, knees) and skeleton.
- **Dynamic Pose Classification:** Automatically recognizes specific poses such as T-pose, Hands Up pose, and Squat pose.
- **Custom Controls:** Allows users to toggle the video feed, keypoints, and skeleton, and to adjust keypoint size.
- **Snapshot Capture:** Enables users to capture and save an image of the current pose.
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas size dynamically adjusts based on the user's window size.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries:**
  - **ml5.js**: Machine learning library built on TensorFlow.js for easy pose detection.
  - **p5.js**: A creative coding library to create the canvas and handle drawing functions.
  - **Flask**: Python web framework used to serve the web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/pose-detection-web-app.git
    cd pose-detection-web-app
    ```

2. Install Flask if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

3. Create an `index.html` file in the `templates` directory if it doesn't already exist. You can use the provided HTML code in the project for the main interface.

4. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

- **Pose Detection:** The application will automatically start capturing video and detecting poses as soon as you load the page.
- **Controls:**
  - **Toggle Video Feed:** Start or stop displaying the webcam feed.
  - **Toggle Keypoints:** Show or hide the detected key points on the body.
  - **Toggle Skeleton:** Show or hide the skeleton connecting the key points.
  - **Capture Snapshot:** Capture the current canvas and download it as an image file.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Press **S** to capture and save a snapshot.
  - Press **K** to toggle keypoints on/off.
  - Press **L** to toggle skeleton on/off.
  - Press **+** to increase keypoint size.
  - Press **-** to decrease keypoint size.
  - Press **V** to toggle the video feed.

## Pose Classification

The app currently detects and classifies the following poses:
- **T-Pose:** When both wrists are aligned with shoulders, and hands are spread wide apart.
- **Hands Up Pose:** When both wrists are above shoulder level.
- **Squat Pose:** When both knees are bent below the hip.

For other poses, the app will display **"No Pose Detected"** and maintain a black background.

## Project Structure

```bash

└── README.md                 # Project README file
```

## Future Improvements

- **Pose Customization:** Add more custom poses for detection.
- **Accuracy Improvements:** Fine-tune the threshold for pose classification.
- **Multiplayer Support:** Detect poses of multiple people simultaneously.
- **Additional Features:** Add more advanced features like pose comparison or fitness tracking.
